**NOTE**: I don't think I like the style, with the greenoids and the irony. I still do want to be sarcastic and put myself in the shoes of a bigot, but the narrative here is annoying.

Hi, bigot. I know, I hate them too. Those damn greenoids! I'm not like them and neither are you. They're different, so we hate them.

It's a good thing that they are green, right? We can easily identify them and just wait until they're not around to say jokes about them. Not that we wouldn't like to give them a piece of our minds, but we'd rather avoid uncomfortable situations.

But what about those damn dreroys? We hate them too, they're different. The problem is, they look like us! There's no easy way to tell if someone is a dreroy or not. Fortunately they're a minority, so most of the time you can just say nasty things about them to random strangers

What are the actual chances of running into a dreroy? Let's say the fraction of dreroys is `p`. p could go from 0 to 1, but it's likely to be a number close to 0. They are a minority after all. This means that the chances that a random person is a filthy dreroy is p.

Now whenever I have a good dreroy joke, it's nice to have a big, large crowd to share it with. But I don't want any dreroys in my crowd, because that would be unconfortable. I want to know what the chances are of addressing a random crowd of size N with no dreroys in it.

Well, that means that none of the N members of the crowd should be dreroys. Since the proportions of dreroys is p, then the chances of not being a dreroy is (1 - p). Assuming independent probabilities, the chances of having a nice and dreroy-free crowd are:

(1 - p)^N

That is, the probability of not being a dreroy elevated to the crowd size.

What does this mean? The number (1 - p) is between 0 and 1. But since p is close to 0, (1-p) will be close to 1. So for low values of N, (1-p)^N, the chances that we're in a dreroy-free crowd, will still be quite large. The odds are in our favor! We can whip up that amusing dreroy joke! They'll laugh, I'll laugh, we'll all laugh.

But what if N gets a bit larger? Say, you were invited to your cousin's wedding and you sit in a table of, say 10-15 people. You want to break the ice, so that awesome dreroy joke would fit the bill. What are your chances now?

If p is 0.1, (1-p) is 0.9. N is 10. You know how much 0.9^10 is?

0.35

Yikes So 1 out of 3 times, your joke will land in a good hands. But 2 out of three you'll offend one dreroy. They're
